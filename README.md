# Project LIRI
**GETTING STARTED**:
To run the program, find the files in Bash/Terminal and type in "node liri.js." The program should run automatically once program is opened.

If the program is not running automatically, please make sure you have all the prerequisites listed below and the path to open the file has the corresponding readMe.

**STATEMENT OF PURPOSE**:
Project LIRI is similar to the popular iPhone "SIRI". Project LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. Project LIRI is a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

Project LIRI was created to showcases the use of Node js via Spotify API, Twitter API, OMDB API, and reading textfiles. Used Inquirer NPM for user input validation.

**PREREQUISITES**:
- Node.js
- JavaScript
- Terminal / Bash / command line prompt
- Capability to run files in package.json (dotenv, inquirer, twitter, spotify, request)
- Perfered viewing in English language :us:

**HOW TO USE**:
Once the program loads a main menu is loaded up with 4 choices (get Tweets, get a Spotify Song, get a Movie, read a file and do what the file types). The user is able to select one of the 4 options.

If the user selects on "Get my Tweets" the progam will display 20 of the lastest tweets.

If the user selects on"Get a Spotify Song" the program will display the artist, song, a preview link, and album.

If the user selects on "Get a movie" the program will display the title, year of the movie, IMDB rating, Rotten Tomato rating, country of origin, the plot, and actors from the movie.

If the user selects on "Read a file & Do What it Says" the program will read the "random.txt" file within the same folder of "liri.js" and preforms one of the 4 options listed above and passes in the name of the song or movie.

As soon as the program completes one of the 4 questions, there is a 2 second time delay asking if the user wants to continue running the program. If the user choose yes, then the the main menu is called again, else the program will terminate and a "Goodbye" message is displayed.
